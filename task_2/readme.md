This README file provides a clear overview of Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris dataset. The objective is to derive meaningful insights using statistical analysis and visualizations.

NOTE:since interactive is not visualized here in github, I have uploaded screenshots of those.

1.Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Plotly  
- NumPy  


2.Objective

To understand the structure, relationships, and patterns in the dataset using visual and statistical techniques.


3.Steps Performed

1. Loaded the iris.csv dataset and explored basic info using head(), info(), and describe().  
2. Checked for missing values and dataset shape.  
3. Generated histograms for each numeric feature to analyze distributions.  
4. Created boxplots to detect outliers and understand feature spread.  
5. Used pairplots and heatmaps to study relationships between features.  
6. Plotted interactive 2D and 3D scatter plots using Plotly for in-depth visualization.  
7. Created violin plots and count plots for detailed distribution analysis across species.  
8. Printed inferences from the analysis to summarize patterns and separability among species.  


4.Key Insights

- Petal features are most effective in distinguishing species.  
- Setosa is clearly separable from the other two species.  
- Versicolor and Virginica show overlap in some features but differ in petal size.  
- Dataset is clean and balanced with no missing values.  
- Petal length and width are highly correlated (correlation ≈ 0.96).  


5.Output Files

- EDA visuals (histograms, boxplots, pairplots, etc.)  
- Console outputs with printed inferences  
- EDA report .docx  


6.Conclusion

This EDA task successfully provided a comprehensive understanding of the Iris dataset and prepares it for further modeling or feature selection.
